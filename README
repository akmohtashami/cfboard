A very minimalistic code, I wrote as a teacher to monitor my students progress on Codeforces. 

You can assign weights to different level of problems in config.php. 
processData.php should be called regularly (e.g. using a cron job) to update progress of users. 
Users can be created via createUser method or by directly inserting to db. 

By default problems from Div.1 contests are ignored to avoid counting overlapping problems twice. You can change this behaviour in contests.php.
